# headless-mule-reload

Reload your mules without [muledump](https://github.com/jakcodex/muledump/) UI.

Does exactly same requests as [muledump](https://github.com/jakcodex/muledump/), only without UI.
This means it can be run in a headless server. Yay!

## Usage

1. Install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)
1. Export `accounts.js` from your muledump
1. place it into project's root directory
1. `lein run`
